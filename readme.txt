== Description ==
When one word won't do.

The bigram WordPress plugin has "specific behaviour".

Its purpose is to make it easy to gather all instances of the bigrams
which are pairs of words where the first word starts with an 'S'
and the second word starts with a 'B'.

It's only needed on the website www.bigram.co.uk

But the code itself could quite educational since it tries to do things in WordPress
that you wouldn't normally attempt. 



== Installation ==
1. Upload the contents of the bigram plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/bigram' directory
1. Activate the bigram plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
